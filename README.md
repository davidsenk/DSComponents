# DSComponents

Reusable Blazor Components.

The goal of this project is to provide, simple, easy to use, components in Blazor. As of now, it is a slow work in progress, the short term goal is to include all of the different bootstrap components into easy to use Blazor compontents. For example, want to insert a Bootstrap Icon for a down arrow? `<ArrowDown/>`. Want something that I haven't made a specific component for yet? `<BIGeneric Icon="cloud" Color="Red"/>`.

I want to have well named, generic, UI components, meant to easily drop in to a Blazor project.
